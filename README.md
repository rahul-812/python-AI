# python-AI
this is a AI based Python project. I have used Pycharm https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows to write this project. I wanted to make the machine perform some task by just saying it. To do this I used these modules

1. re ( RegEx ) - to match user's question in a pattern
2. datetime - to use system's default date time
3. os - to find files ( music and video ) in local drive
4. pathlib - to make directory paths operating system independent
5. random - to chose files randomly
6. pyjokes - to get random jokes
7. webbrowser - to open websites
8. pywhatkit - to send massage on whatsapp, google search, play video on YouTube
9. pyttsx3 - to get a tts ( TALK TO SPEECH ) engine
10. speech_recognition - to use Google Web Speech API
11. wikipedia - to pick lines from https://wikipedia.com
12. PyAudio - as a dependency
